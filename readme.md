## What is Image Classification Part 2

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our
[website](https://www.taipy.io).

[Image Classification Part 2](https://github.com/Avaiga/image-classification-part-2) is about how to use Taipy Core and Taipy Studio to efficiently create and manage Data and ML pipelines. 

### Demo Type
- **Level**: Intermediate
- **Topic**: Taipy-CORE
- **Components/Controls**: 
  - Taipy CORE: configs, Taipy Studio

## How to run

This demo works with a Python version superior to 3.8. Install the dependencies of the *Pipfile* and run the *main.py*.

## Introduction
The Demo is the second part of the Image Classification App using Taipy and Tensorflow, and it is recommended to watch the first part or go through the repo to understand the main functions and tasks. 

The video on Youtubecovers using Taipy Core and Taipy Studio to build pipelines and manage different scenarios. The demo covers copying necessary functions into a script file, configuring datanodes, specifying functions for tasks, configuring pipelines, and executing the scenario with Taipy Studio and/or Taipy Core.
